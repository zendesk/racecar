# Racecar

Introducing Racecar, your friendly and easy-to-approach Kafka consumer framework!

Using [ruby-kafka](https://github.com/zendesk/ruby-kafka) directly can be a challenge: it's a flexible library with lots of knobs and options. Most users don't need that level of flexibility, though.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'racecar'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install racecar

## Usage

Add a file in e.g. `app/consumers/user_ban_consumer.rb`:

```ruby
class UserBanConsumer
  extend Racecar::Consumer

  subscribes_to "user_banned"

  def process(message)
    data = JSON.parse(message.value)
    user = User.find(data["user_id"])
    user.banned = true
    user.save!
  end
end
```

Now run your consumer with `bundle exec racecar UserBanConsumer`.

That's all there is to it.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
